# Chrome-Startpage
First startpage project for me.

Nothing but HTML / CSS and tad bit Javascript for the clock.

Dark colors for a non-aggressive experience and late night browsing.

Direct link to where it is hosted, you can use as is if you want or download it.

To change the links to your own, open the index.html file, go down to where the links are listed and change the URL and the name associated to them.

Enjoy :)
